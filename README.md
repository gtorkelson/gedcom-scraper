The Gedcom Solvent browser extension is intended to allow genealogists (enthusiast or professional) to extract genealogical information in the form of GEDCOM files from sites where they appear, for the purpose of collaboration (subject to the above). It may be valuable to those who wish to research their relationships with cousins identified in autosomal DNA testing.

At this time, it is believed to be compatible with recent versions of Chrome and Firefox, and Safari may work as well. Internet Explorer is not supported at this time.

## Usage

Install the appropriate build for your browser from the output directory.

Thereafter, on a supported site/page (i.e. the tree of one of your matches on FamilyTree DNA), the extension will present itself as an orange button. Press the button.

## What Not to Do

Please do not use this in a manner that may violate the spirit of your agreement(s) with service providers, and **MOST IMPORTANTLY** do not use it in a manner that could even remotely resememble the violation of anyone's privacy.

### Supported sites

* FamilyTree DNA trees
* GEDMatch
